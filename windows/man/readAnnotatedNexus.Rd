\title{Read annotated tree files in a Nexus format}
\description{
This function reads annotated trees from files in a Nexus format. Except for the annotations, this functions mimic the R package "ape" function "read.nexus". Annotations are ordered by edges, i.e. matching the \code{edge.length} slot of a \code{phylo} object.
}
\usage{
readAnnotatedNexus(file, tree.names=NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a file name specified by either a variable of mode character, or a double-quoted string; if ‘file = ""’ (the default) then the tree is input on the keyboard, the entry being terminated with a blank line}
  \item{tree.names}{if there are several trees to be read, a vector of mode character that gives names to the individual trees; if ‘NULL’ (the default), the trees are named ‘"tree1"’, ‘"tree2"’, ...}
}
\details{
See the function "read.nexus" in the R package "ape" for a specification of Nexus formatted tree files. This function additionally extracts BEAST annotations for all branches/nodes in the trees and returns these annotations as lists of lists in the resulting "phylo" objects
}
\value{
An object of class "phylo" with an additional slot called annotations. This slot is a list indexed by the nodes.
